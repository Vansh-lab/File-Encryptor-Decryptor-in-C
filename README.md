# File-Encryptor-Decryptor-in-C
Developed a Caesar Cipher-based file encryption tool in C that supports custom numeric keys and handles full file input/output for secure text transformation. Implemented both encryption and decryption modes via command-line UI.

# 🔐 File Encryptor & Decryptor (Caesar Cipher in C)

This project is a command-line C program that encrypts and decrypts text files using a simple Caesar Cipher algorithm. Users can specify a shift key, input file, and output file, making this a functional beginner-level encryption tool with real-world file I/O handling.

Features

- 🔒 Encrypt `.txt` files using Caesar Cipher logic
- 🔓 Decrypt using the same numeric key
- 🧠 Character shifting with wrap-around for both uppercase and lowercase letters
- 📁 File I/O: reads from and writes to user-defined files
- 🧾 Menu-driven interface for ease of use

Technologies Used

- C Programming Language
- File Handling (`fopen`, `fgetc`, `fputc`)
- Caesar Cipher logic
- CLI (Command-Line Interface)

 📄 Example

**Input File (`input.txt`):**
